It waits for a specific event, like someone using your app in a certain way, and then kicks things off. It's the starting line for every Flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Action: These are the doers in your Flows. Actions could be anything from sending out emails and creating PDFs to calling up an API service. They work with inputs and can produce outputs for the next steps in the Flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transformer: Need to change your data somehow? That's what Transformers are for. They can tweak, extract, convert, or manipulate your data in almost any way you need. You can chain Transformers together for more complex transformations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Condition: These are the decision-makers. Based on a true or false outcome, Conditions steer your Flow in different directions, adding decision-making logic to the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Groups: Some blocks are like containers for other blocks. Backendless supports two types: Triggers Group and Actions Group, which help manage how grouped triggers or actions work together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow Editor: This is where the magic happens. The Flow Editor is your canvas for creating, tweaking, testing, and running your Flows. It's a graphical interface that turns your ideas into automation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test Mode: Before going live, you'll want to ensure everything works perfectly. Test Mode in the Flow Editor lets you run tests using test data to debug and refine every part of your Flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>SLA Condition: These are benchmarks within your service level agreements (SLA) that set the performance standards. Backendless keeps an eye on these to make sure everything's running smoothly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-compliance Rule: If things aren't going according to plan, these rules define what steps to take.

This result can range from a straightforward data point to a complex set of information. Consider a scenario where a trigger activates upon submitting a web form. This trigger captures detailed information a customer provides, storing it as a \"result\" that can be further utilized within the flow. You can assign a user-friendly name to each result element.
