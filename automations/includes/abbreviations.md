*[key/value structure]: 
    A key/value pairs structure, also known as an object, is a method of organizing<br> and storing data. Imagine it as a labeled filing cabinet where drawer has a<br> specific label, and inside each drawer is a piece of information. The label on the<br> drawer is the key, and the information inside is the value.<br><br> For instance, if you have an object to store information about a person, you might<br> have a key called "name" with the value "Alice". Another key could be "age" with the<br> value "30". This way, if you want to find out the person's age, you look for the<br> "age" key and find the value "30" associated with it.<br>
