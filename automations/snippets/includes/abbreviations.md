*[key/value format]: 
    A key/value pairs structure, also known as an object, is a method of organizing<br> and storing data. Imagine it as a labeled filing cabinet where drawer has a<br> specific label, and inside each drawer is a piece of information. The label on the<br> drawer is the key, and the information inside is the value.<br><br> For instance, if you have an object to store information about a person, you might<br> have a key called "name" with the value "Alice". Another key could be "age" with the<br> value "30". This way, if you want to find out the person's age, you look for the<br> "age" key and find the value "30" associated with it.<br>

*[data bucket]:
    A data bucket is a way to organize and store related pieces of information together. <br>Think of it as a labeled box where you can keep various items that belong to a <br>specific category. Each piece of information, or variable, in the box has its own label,<br>making it easy to find and use. For example, if you have settings that apply to<br>an entire project, you might put all those settings in a data bucket called "Project Settings". This helps keep your information organized and easy to manage.
