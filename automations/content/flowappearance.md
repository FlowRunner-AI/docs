# Customizing Flow Appearance

In the ever-evolving landscape of Backendless Automations, personalization plays a key role in enhancing the user experience. While the current scope for customization may seem modest, it opens up a world of visual management for your automation flows. Presently, the customization available to you involves changing the color of a flow's title bar. This feature might seem simple at first glance, but it's a powerful tool for organizing and quickly identifying your flows, especially as your collection grows. Let's dive into how you can inject a bit of color and personality into your automation flows.

## Changing Your Flow's Color

1. **Navigate to the Flow Manager**: Start by opening the Flow Manager in your Backendless app. This is where all your automation flows are displayed and managed.

2. **Locate the Flow**: Browse through the list of your flows and find the one you wish to customize. Take your time to select the right flow for color customization.

3. **Access Management Icons**: Move your cursor over the title bar of the flow you've chosen. As you hover over it, you will see various management icons appear. These icons provide different options for managing your flow.

4. **Click the "Change Color" Icon**: Look for the icon that represents changing the color — it might look like a palette or a dropper. Click on this icon to open the color picker tool.

5. **Select a Color**: With the color picker now open, you can choose any color that fits your preference or organizational system. The color picker offers a wide spectrum of colors, allowing for precise selection.

6. **Apply the Color**: Once you've selected a color, the title bar of your flow will immediately change to reflect your choice. This newly applied color will help your flow stand out among others, making it easier to identify at a glance.
