# Deleting Flows

Deleting flows helps keep your automation workspace organized by removing flows that are no longer needed. Whether created for testing or no longer relevant, deleting flows is straightforward in FlowRunner™.  

### How to Delete a Flow  

1. Open the **Flow Manager** and select the flow you want to delete.  
2. Click the :octicons-three-bars-16: icon to open the Flow admin menu.
2. Click the **Delete* Flow** option.  
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup. Deleting a flow will permanently remove all its versions and associated analytics.

### Key Considerations  

- **Active Flows:** You cannot delete a flow with a `LIVE` version. Stop any running versions before proceeding.  
- **Permanent Action:** Deleting a flow is irreversible. All data, including versions and analytics, will be permanently removed.  
- **Dependencies:** Ensure the flow isn’t part of other workflows or dependencies that could disrupt your automation.  

By carefully managing deletions, you can keep your FlowRunner™ environment clean, efficient, and focused on the flows that matter.
