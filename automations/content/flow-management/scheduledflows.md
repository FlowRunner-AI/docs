# Scheduled Flows
Scheduled Flows in FlowRunner™ let you automate business processes by defining when and how often a flow should execute. Whether generating weekly reports, running maintenance tasks, or processing recurring updates, scheduled flows ensure automation runs seamlessly at the times you specify.  

## Creating a Schedule  

To set up a schedule for a flow version:  

1. Open the **Flow Manager**, select your flow/version and navigate to the **VERSION ADMIN** tab.
2. Click the **CONFIGURE SCHEDULE** button in the **Flow Schedule** section:  
   ![configure schedule](../images/version-schedule.png)  

2. In the `Configure Flow Schedule` popup, define the schedule’s parameters, including:  
   - **Start Time:** When the flow should first execute.  
   - **Frequency:** How often the flow should run.  
   - **Expiration (optional):** The date/time when the schedule should stop automatically.

Schedules are activated when the flow version is started, either through the FlowRunner™ user interface or programmatically via the API. Note that each flow version can have its own unique schedule.  

## Flow Execution Policy  

The **Flow Execution Policy** section in the `Configure Flow Schedule` popup provides additional control over how your flows are triggered:  

- **Allow only scheduled flow instances:** Enabling this option ensures that new flow instances are created exclusively by the scheduler. If disabled, and the flow begins with a trigger, instances can also be created by events generated by the trigger. Use this option to guarantee that scheduling remains the sole mechanism for starting new instances when enabled.  
- **Allow flow instantiation via API when the schedule expires:** This option is available only when an expiration date/time is set. When enabled, new flow instances can be created via the [Call Flow API](../flow-execution/overview.md#callflow-commandapi) after the schedule has expired.  

These options give you fine-grained control over how and when flows can be executed, ensuring alignment with your automation strategy.  

## Start Times and Expiration  

The **start time** determines when a schedule first triggers and sets the timing for recurring executions. Adding an **expiration date** ensures the schedule stops after a specific period, preventing unnecessary resource usage and providing better control over long-running processes.  

## Frequency Options  

FlowRunner™ offers flexible frequency settings to match various automation needs:  

![schedule frequencies](../images/schedule-frequencies.png)  

- **Once:** Execute the flow at a specific time.  
- **Every X seconds:** Repeat execution at intervals of 60 seconds or longer.  
- **Daily:** Run the flow every day or at custom intervals.  
- **Weekly:** Execute on specific days each week, ideal for tasks like reporting.  
- **Monthly:** Schedule execution on specific days or recurring weekdays each month.  
- **Cron:** Use a [cron expression](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) for advanced scheduling.  

## Schedule Indicator
When a flow version has a schedule, you will see an icon indicating it:

## Removing a Schedule  

To stop a scheduled flow:  
1. Open the **Configure Flow Schedule** popup.  
2. Click the **REMOVE SCHEDULING** button located in the lower-right corner of the interface.

This action deactivates the schedule, preventing future executions. Active instances of the flow that were triggered before removal will continue to run until completed.
