# Service Level Agreements


// coming soon!

### :fontawesome-solid-handshake: - Configure SLA goals
The **Configure SLA Goals** action takes you to a section of FlowRunner™ where you can define service level agreement (SLA) goals for your flow. These goals help you measure and monitor compliance by evaluating whether specific outcomes or states are achieved within defined timeframes.  

SLA goals are closely tied to business calendars, which determine your organization’s operating hours. From the same section, you can manage these calendars to ensure SLA measurements accurately reflect your business’s time-based expectations.  

By setting SLA goals and linking them to operating hours, you can track performance against critical business objectives and ensure your automation processes stay on target.
