# Creating New Flows

Embarking on your journey with FlowRunner™ begins with creating new flows. Flows are the essence of automation, enabling you to streamline complex processes into efficient, automated sequences. This chapter focuses on the initial steps of setting up a flow: crafting its identity with a name and enriching it with a description. Here, we'll guide you through the straightforward process of bringing a new flow to life.

## Creating a Flow

The creation of a new flow in FlowRunner™ is both a simple and significant first step toward automating your business processes. Follow these steps to create your flow:

1. **Navigate to Flow Manager:** Your adventure starts in the Flow Manager, the control center for all your automation activities. Here, you'll find the tools and options to manage your flows.

2. **Create New Flow:** Look for the **`CREATE A NEW FLOW`** button. This is your gateway to initiating a new automation. Clicking this button brings you to the first step of flow creation.

3. **Enter Flow Name:** Upon initiating a new flow, you’ll be prompted to give it a name. This name is how you'll identify your flow within the FlowRunner™ platform, so choose something descriptive and meaningful.

4. **Add a Description (Optional):** While optional, adding a description is highly recommended. This is where you outline the flow's purpose and any other important notes that will guide you or your collaborators in understanding its function.

5. **Confirm Creation:** With a name and an optional description in place, confirm the creation of your new flow by clicking the **`CREATE`** button. This action generates the flow and its first editable version within the system.

## Flow Name

The name you choose for your flow serves as its primary identifier and should succinctly convey its purpose. Here are some tips for naming your flow:

- **Be Descriptive and Specific:** Use names that clearly indicate what the flow does, such as “Customer Onboarding Process” or “Weekly Sales Report Generator.”

- **Consistency is Key:** If your organization has existing naming conventions, stick to them. Consistency helps with organization and ease of finding specific flows later.

## Flow Description

Though optional, a well-crafted description is invaluable. It provides context and clarifies the flow’s intent and mechanics, especially for collaborative projects. When adding a description, consider the following:

- **Outline the Flow’s Purpose:** Explain what the flow is designed to achieve. This overview helps anyone working with or reviewing the flow to understand its objectives quickly.

- **Include Key Details:** Mention any important triggers, actions, or conditions that are central to the flow’s operation. This information can be crucial for maintenance or future modifications.

- **Keep it Clear and Concise:** While being thorough, aim for clarity and brevity. The goal is to communicate effectively, not to overwhelm with details.

Once created, your new flow and its first version are ready for further development. At this stage, you can begin the creative process of structuring your automation by planning and eventually implementing the flow’s components and logic. This initial step of naming and describing your flow lays the groundwork for the automation magic that follows.
