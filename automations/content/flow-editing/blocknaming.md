# Naming Your Blocks  

Block names in FlowRunner™ play a crucial role in maintaining clarity and understanding within your workflows. Assigning meaningful, context-specific names helps align blocks with your business processes, making workflows easier to navigate, understand, and maintain.  

## Contextual Naming  

Pre-defined block names describe generic functions, but they may not reflect the specifics of your business operations. Renaming blocks to fit their role in your workflow improves clarity.  

For example:  

- Rename **Save Record in Database** to **Save Customer Details** to highlight its purpose.  
- Update **Condition** to **Has the Customer Ordered from Us Before?** for immediate context.  

Meaningful names make it easier for you and your team to understand a workflow at a glance.

## Using the `Name` Property  

Each block includes a **Name** property that allows for customization. Assigning descriptive names as soon as you place blocks on the canvas is a best practice. This ensures your workflow is intuitive and reflects your business processes clearly.  

Naming blocks isn’t just about aesthetics - it’s essential for creating workflows that are clear, maintainable, and aligned with your business objectives. Thoughtful naming ensures workflows are accessible to your team, accurately represent your processes, and support effective automation.
