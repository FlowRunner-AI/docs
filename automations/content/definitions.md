Welcome to the "Terminology" chapter of the Backendless Automations User Guide. Understanding the terms used here is key to understanding how everything works. It'll make your journey with Backendless Automations smoother and more intuitive. Let's explore the essential terms you'll encounter in this system.

### The Basics

- **Flow:** The Flow is at the heart of Backendless Automations. It's a sequence of events and actions set up to automate various tasks, whether they're for business processes, service functions, or anything in between. You can customize Flows to achieve different goals, making the system incredibly flexible.

- **Flow Version:** Flows aren't static; they evolve. That's where versions come in. You can have several versions of a Flow, each with tweaks or changes. Although you can only have one version active at any time, cloning and editing make updates easy. Remember, you can't edit a Flow that's running; you need to clone it, make your changes, stop the current version, and launch your new one.

### Components of a Flow

- **Block:** This is a catch-all term for the essentials of your Flows: Triggers, Actions, Transformers, and Conditions. Think of these as the Lego blocks of Backendless Automations.

- **Trigger:** A Trigger is what starts your Flow. It waits for a specific event, like someone using your app in a certain way, and then kicks things off. It's the starting line for every Flow.

- **Action:** These are the doers in your Flows. Actions could be anything from sending out emails and creating PDFs to calling up an API service. They work with inputs and can produce outputs for the next steps in the Flow.

- **Transformer:** Need to change your data somehow? That's what Transformers are for. They can tweak, extract, convert, or manipulate your data in almost any way you need. You can chain Transformers together for more complex transformations.

- **Condition:** These are the decision-makers. Based on a true or false outcome, Conditions steer your Flow in different directions, adding decision-making logic to the process.

- **Groups:** Some blocks are like containers for other blocks. Backendless supports two types: Triggers Group and Actions Group, which help manage how grouped triggers or actions work together.

- **Flow Editor:** This is where the magic happens. The Flow Editor is your canvas for creating, tweaking, testing, and running your Flows. It's a graphical interface that turns your ideas into automation.

- **Test Mode:** Before going live, you'll want to ensure everything works perfectly. Test Mode in the Flow Editor lets you run tests using test data to debug and refine every part of your Flow.

- **SLA Condition:** These are benchmarks within your service level agreements (SLA) that set the performance standards. Backendless keeps an eye on these to make sure everything's running smoothly.

- **Non-compliance Rule:** If things aren't going according to plan, these rules define what steps to take. They're part of your SLA, ensuring that standards are met or actions are taken if they're not.

- **SLA Configurator:** This tool within the Flow Editor helps you set up and manage your SLA conditions and non-compliance rules. It's essential for maintaining the reliability and performance of your Flows.

By getting familiar with these terms, you're unlocking the door to all the possibilities Backendless Automations offers. With this knowledge, navigating and using the system to enhance your business processes will feel more intuitive and empowering.
