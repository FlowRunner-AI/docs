# Deleting Flows

In the process of refining your automation setup with Backendless Automations, you might find yourself needing to delete flows that are no longer relevant, were created for testing, or need to be removed for any other reason. It's important to approach this task with a clear understanding of what flow deletion entails. This chapter will guide you through the necessary steps to delete a flow and highlight crucial considerations you should be aware of before proceeding with this action.

## Steps for Deleting a Flow

Deleting a flow is a straightforward process within Backendless Automations, designed to ensure that your workspace remains organized and focused only on the flows that are of current value to you. Here's how to delete a flow:

1. **Navigate to Flow Manager:** Your first step is to access the Flow Manager, which is the central hub for all your flow management needs.

2. **Locate the Flow:** Browse or search through your list of flows to find the one you wish to delete. Take a moment to ensure that you have selected the correct flow for deletion.

3. **Reveal Management Icons:** Move your mouse pointer over the title bar of the flow you're targeting. This action will display the management icons, including the "delete" icon.

4. **Initiate Deletion:** Click on the "delete" icon. This action will trigger a confirmation popup, which serves as a safeguard against accidental deletions.

5. **Confirm Deletion:** The confirmation popup is your final check before the deletion proceeds. It's crucial to understand that deleting a flow will remove all its versions and all associated analytics permanently. If you're certain about your decision, confirm the deletion.

## Important Considerations

Before you delete a flow, keep the following considerations in mind:

- **Running Versions:** Deletion is not permitted if the flow has a version currently in a "LIVE" state. You must first stop any running versions before you can delete the flow. This ensures that active processes are not abruptly terminated.

- **Permanent Action:** Flow deletion is irreversible. This means that once a flow is deleted, all its information, including versions and analytics, is permanently removed from your Backendless Automations account.

- **Check Dependencies:** Be mindful of how the flow interacts within your broader automation strategy. Consider whether other processes or workflows depend on the flow you plan to delete. Removing a flow without assessing its integrations could disrupt your operations.

Deleting flows is a crucial aspect of managing your automation environment, ensuring it remains clean and efficient. By following the outlined steps and giving due consideration to the implications of deletion, you can maintain an organized and effective automation setup in Backendless Automations.
