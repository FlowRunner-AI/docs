# Renaming Flows

As you dive deeper into creating and managing your automated workflows with Backendless Automations, you'll find the need to keep your projects organized and clearly identifiable. Renaming flows becomes a crucial task in this organizational effort, ensuring that each flow reflects its current purpose or version accurately. This chapter focuses on the process of renaming flows within the Flow Manager and the importance of maintaining unique names across your account.

## The Importance of Unique Names

Before we delve into the steps of renaming a flow, it's essential to understand the importance of uniqueness in flow names. Each flow within your Backendless account must have a unique name. This requirement avoids confusion, ensures clarity in flow management, and simplifies the task of identifying and accessing specific flows. A unique naming convention assists in better organization and efficient management of your automated processes, especially as the number of flows in your account grows.

## Steps for Renaming a Flow

Renaming a flow in Backendless Automations is a straightforward process that can be done from the Flow Manager. Follow these steps to rename an existing flow:

1. **Access Flow Manager:** Start by navigating to the Flow Manager within Backendless Automations. This is your central dashboard where all your flows are listed and managed.

2. **Select the Flow:** Identify the flow you wish to rename from the list of available flows. Each flow entry should have an associated set of actions or a context menu.

3. **Initiate Rename Action:** Move the mouse pointer over the header of the flow you would like to rename. Management icons will appear. Click the “Rename”  (pencil) icon.

4. **Enter the New Name:** After initiating the rename action, you'll be prompted to enter a new name for your flow. This is your opportunity to update the flow’s name to something more descriptive, accurate, or aligned with any new naming conventions you’ve adopted.

5. **Check for Uniqueness:** Before finalizing the new name, ensure that it's unique within your account. The Flow Manager may automatically check this for you, but it's good practice to be mindful of existing names to avoid conflicts.

6. **Save Changes:** Once you've entered a new, unique name for your flow, save your changes. Your flow will now be updated with the new name across the Backendless Automations platform.

## Best Practices for Naming Flows

When renaming flows, consider the following best practices to maintain a clear and efficient organizational structure:

- **Descriptive and Precise:** Choose names that clearly describe the flow’s purpose or the specific process it automates. Precision helps in quickly understanding what each flow does.

- **Follow Naming Conventions:** If your organization or project has specific naming conventions, adhere to them. Consistency in naming facilitates easier navigation and management.

- **Consider Versioning:** If the flow has multiple versions or iterations, consider including version information in the name to distinguish between them easily.

- **Keep it Concise:** While being descriptive, aim to keep flow names concise for ease of reading and quick recognition.

Renaming flows is a simple yet essential part of managing your automated workflows in Backendless Automations. By following the steps and best practices outlined in this chapter, you can ensure that your flows remain well-organized, easily identifiable, and reflective of their current functionality or version.
